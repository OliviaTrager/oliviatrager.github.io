## Editing Content on Hugo Blog

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to edit the content of the Hugo blog hosted at [https://oliviatrager.github.io/](https://oliviatrager.github.io/). The blog's source code is stored on a GitHub repository, and we will be using a VS Code-like interface to make the desired changes.

Please note that this tutorial is intended for non-technical content editors who are familiar with basic text editing and have access to the GitHub repository. Let's get started:

### Step 1: Accessing the Editing Interface

1. Visit the GitHub repository for the blog at [https://github.com/oliviatrager/oliviatrager.github.io](https://github.com/oliviatrager/oliviatrager.github.io).
2. On the repository page, look for the "Code" button and click on it.
3. In the dropdown menu, click on "Open with GitHub Codespaces."

### Step 2: Opening the Desired File

1. Once the VS Code-like interface loads, you will see the repository's file structure on the left-hand side.
2. Navigate to the `content` directory by clicking on it.
3. In the `content` directory, locate the file you wish to edit. For example, if you want to edit a blog post, find the corresponding Markdown (`.md`) file.
4. Click on the file to open it in the editing interface.

### Step 3: Making Changes

1. Once the file is open, you can make the desired changes using the provided rich text editor.
2. Use the formatting options to format text, add links, insert images, and more.
3. As you make changes, you will see a live preview of how the content will look on the blog.

### Step 4: Committing Changes

1. After making the necessary edits, it's time to commit your changes to the GitHub repository.
2. In the VS Code-like interface, look for the source control icon (usually represented by a branch or a similar symbol) on the left-hand side.
3. Click on the source control icon to open the version control panel.
4. Review the changes you made in the "Changes" tab.
5. In the text input field labeled "Message," provide a descriptive commit message that briefly explains the changes you made.
6. Once you have entered the commit message, click on the checkmark or "Commit" button to save your changes to the repository.

Congratulations! You have successfully edited the content of the Hugo blog hosted at [https://oliviatrager.github.io/](https://oliviatrager.github.io/). Your changes will be reflected on the live site once they are merged into the main branch.
